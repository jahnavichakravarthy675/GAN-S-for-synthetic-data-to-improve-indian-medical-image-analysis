# Pneumonia Detection Using GANs and CNNs

This project leverages **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to generate synthetic chest X-ray images and classify them as **Normal** or **Pneumonia**. It addresses challenges like limited labeled medical data, class imbalance, and patient data privacy—especially relevant in healthcare systems with limited resources.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- ✅ **GANs** (CycleGAN, Pix2Pix) generate synthetic pneumonia X-rays
- ✅ **ResNet-18 CNN** for binary classification (Normal vs Pneumonia)
- ✅ **Tkinter GUI** (`app.py`) for real-time interaction
- ✅ **Metrics**: Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall, FID Score
- ✅ **Privacy**: No real patient data required for model training

## 📥 Dataset (Manual Download Required)

Due to file size constraints, the datasets are not included in this repository. Download them manually from these official sources:

### 🧪 NIH Chest X-ray Dataset (112,000+ images)
- 🔗 https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC

### 🏥 RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge
- 🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/data

After downloading, place the dataset in the following directory:

```bash
project-root/
└── dataset/
    ├── images/
    └── labels.csv or similar
```
